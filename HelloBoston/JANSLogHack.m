/*
	JANSLogHack
	By Jens Ayton
	Use of constructor attribute suggested by Jonathan Wight.
	
	Add this file to your project to cause NSLog() messages to be printed to
	standard out.
	
	It is the opinion of the author of this file that it does not have
	sufficient depth to constitute a "work" for the purposes of copyright, and
	is therefore in the public domain by default. If you disagree with this
	assessment, you may contact the author for licensing terms via any of
	several e-mail addresses found at <http://jens.ayton.se/>.
	
	The _NSSetLogCStringFunction() is documented at
	<http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=70081> (in the context of
	WebObjects 4 for Windows NT). However, note that the documentation clearly
	states that the function is private and unsupported. It is strongly
	recommended that this code not be used in production code.
	
	For completeness, I should mention that there is a matching undocumented
	getter, _NSLogCStringFunction(), which takes no parameters and returns a
	function pointer.
